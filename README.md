Here I provide codes used in the study (Evaluation of short-term epigenetic age fluctuation) that is accepted for publication in Clinical Epigenetics.
Codes for DNAm normalization are not provided here. For the normalization, please follow BMIQ manual and Horvath's [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115)/[website](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/dnamage/).
